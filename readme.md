# Bank Manager

The goal of this project is to play with React, Redux, and Socket.io. As a bank manager, the user should be able to see the list of customers and some details about the customer's account. Socket.io should be used to push updates to customer accounts out to all connected users. Redux should be used for state management that drives a React front-end.
